## Learnings
In the process of creating the Workout App, I leveraged various resources to enhance my understanding and skills in the MERN stack. Here are some of the key learnings:

1. **MERN Stack Tutorials**: 
   - I followed the [MERN Stack Tutorial Series 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE&pp=iAQB) and [MERN Stack Tutorial Series 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsRBmwNkv3Q&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g8OhpOZxNdhXggFz2lOuCT&pp=iAQB) by The Net Ninja on YouTube. This comprehensive guide helped me understand the fundamental concepts of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, and how to integrate them to build a full-stack application.
   
2. **Mobile App Development**:
   - To further expand my skill set, I explored how to connect the backend made in Express.js to a React Native app by myself.
